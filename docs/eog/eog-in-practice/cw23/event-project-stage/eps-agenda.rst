CW23 Agenda
============

As we were able to organise CW23 as a hybrid event from the beginning, we were able to be very intentional about the agenda and programme to achieve our :ref:`cw23-fs-goals-and-objectives`. For example, breaks and buffer time were strategically scheduled to allow time for in-person participants to move between spaces, remote participants to find the relevant Zoom rooms, and for the creation of breakout rooms for relevant sessions.


Informing
------------

Keynote Talks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For CW23, we had four ten-minute keynote presentations instead of the usual format of two 30-minute keynote presentations - our Steering Committee suggested that having a range of talks from people with different backgrounds and career journeys would allow us to cover a lot of ground around our theme of Sustainable Career Development.
The remaining 20 minutes of the 60-minute keynote session was dedicated to audience questions and answers, facilitated by the use of `Sli.do <https://www.sli.do/>`_.

The Chair of the session introduced the speakers live and reminded the participants that they could take notes and ask questions in the collaborative notes or via the Sli.do website/app, and that this session would be live streamed via YouTube.
The Event Lead choreographed live streaming the session on YouTube (following `this guide on Captioned video calls AND YouTube streaming by Open Life Science <https://openlifesci.org/posts/2020/12/16/streaming-to-youtube-and-to-otter-at-once/>`_ to get Zoom, YouTube and Otter.ai to work together via Restream - see :ref:`cw23-eps-infrastructure` for more information).

The four keynote speakers attended the session in-person, which was facilitated by the session Chair who relayed questions submitted via Sli.do.

You can `view the live streamed keynote presentations here <https://youtu.be/vqVtB3B8vVo>`_.

Lightning Talks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Lightning talks <https://software.ac.uk/cw23/lightning-talks>`_ provide the perfect opportunity for participants and sponsors to introduce themselves at the workshop.
CW lightning talks are two minutes for one slide, and can be used to showcase a project, introduce a problem, or promote a mini-workshop or demo session later in the programme.

We conducted a call for lightning talks with a short Google Form to help with planning and prioritising new voices, and confirmed lightning talk presenters were then asked to submit their slides to the `Figshare conference portal <https://ssi-cw.figshare.com/>`_ ahead of the event following `these instructions <https://software.ac.uk/cw23/lightning-talks/submit>`_.

We then compiled all the slides into a single slide show to maximise efficiency during the session, and integrated a two-minute timer within each slide to help keep speakers to time and minimise having to cut speakers off (we use the `Slides Timer <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/slides-timer/nfhjdkmpebifdelclimjfaackjhiglpc>`_ Chrome extension with Google Slides).
The A/V provider asked us to space out the remote speakers, alternating between in-person and remote speakers so that they had enough time to queue up the next remote speaker when it was their turn.
The slides were shared via Screen Share in Zoom using the laptop in the in-person plenary room.
When their names were displayed on the screen, the in-person speaker was invited to step up to the podium or the remote speaker was invited to unmute when it was their turn and deliver their lightning talk.
The advancement of the slides was facilitated using a USB-remote/clicker, as the Slides Timer integration can be finicky, and this helped the session to run smoothly and within time.

Exploring
------------

Discussion Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Discussion session <https://software.ac.uk/cw23/discussion-session>`_ allows groups of people to discuss a topic that interests them in a way that furthers our knowledge of that topic.
This session is a fundamental part of the Collaborations Workshop: it helps people learn about new ideas and work together on solving shared problems.
The output of the discussion session is a `speed blog post <http://bit.ly/ssi-speed-blogging>`_ from each group to help disseminate the insights to the wider community.

The session was conducted in a similar way as during :ref:`CW21 <cw21-eps-agenda>`.

Participants suggested and signed up to the topics that they wanted to discuss in a spreadsheet (`example spreadsheet <https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12498278>`__).
The Group IDs were once again the letters of the alphabet, and the associated Group Names were fruit names that began with that letter.
For example, Group ID A had Group Name Avocado, Group ID B had Group Name Blueberry, and so on.
We adapted this for a hybrid event by pre-assigning the Group IDs to spaces, each with a designated in-person location and an associated Zoom breakout room.

We set up the in-person venue in the following way.
We set up a Meeting OWL (we had four in total) in its own room within the venue (we used the Eddington, Foster, Robinson rooms and the Executive Boardroom for this) and assigned OWL Managers to assist with set up of the OWL and session for each space.
We printed out signs for each Group ID and placed them on tables throughout the plenary room and for each Meeting OWL room.

We set up the remote participation in the following way, taking advantage of the Zoom feature that allows participants to self-select their own breakout rooms in Zoom along with the added `functionality of live transcription and captioning <https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4403492514829-Viewing-captions-in-a-meeting-or-webinar>`_ within Zoom breakout rooms.
30 breakout rooms were created (with the option selected to allow participants to choose their rooms), with 26 renamed to "<Group ID> - <Group Name>" (for example "A - Avocado") along with a few extra side rooms.

We asked remote participants to include "(R)" at the end of their names when they signed up to discussion topics in the spreadsheet.
One change from previous CWs, is that we removed the limit of the number of people that could be on a team, as this was the highest number of participants that have attended a CW and we were limited by the number of in-person spaces.
A designated Group Assignment Manager assessed the groups as they formed, and assigned larger hybrid groups to rooms that had Meeting OWLs.
The groups were directed to their discussion group reporting document via the “Groups” tab in the spreadsheet, in which they worked together on their `speed blog posts <https://software.ac.uk/tags/cw23-speed-blog-posts>`_.


Collaborative Ideas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Collaborative Ideas <https://software.ac.uk/cw21/collaborative-ideas-session>`_ session is used to get people talking about their work.
They identify problems within research software and come up with a solution, usually a project that can be taken forward to the CW Hack Day.

The session was facilitated in a similar way to the Discussion session except that the groups for the breakout spaces were pre-assigned based on the job roles that participants provided during registration to ensure a mix of roles and research domains in each group, providing the opportunity to meet and collaborate with new people.
We pre-assigned four hybrid groups and assigned them to the Group IDs/spaces with Meeting OWLs, and the rest of the groups consisted of fully in-person or remote participants to ease discussion.

This time the Group Names were based on birds (Albatross, Blackbird, and Crane to name a few), so the group that was assigned to breakout room "Albatross" retrieved their Collaborative Ideas document for Group Name Albatross in the associated spreadsheet (`example spreadsheet <https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12500768>`_), and so on.

Following its success during CW22, voting was facilitated through a Google Form, where participants where asked to vote for their favourite top three ideas.
One update for the session during CW23, was the introduction of a designated session during which participants had time to read through and vote for the Collaborative Ideas.
The votes were tallied at the end of Day 2, and the teams with the top three ideas were awarded prizes.
This year, the prizes were the participants' choice between Blackwells UK, Amazon UK, Love2Shop UK or Love2Shop International digital gift vouchers due to the `voucher policy at the University of Manchester <https://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/finance/purchasing/vouchers/>`_.

You can read more details about how we run the Collaborative Ideas session in the Collaborations Workshop section of the `CSCCE's guide to Using virtual events to facilitate community building: event formats <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3934384>`_.


Creating
------------

Hack Day
^^^^^^^^^^^

CW23 concluded with the `Hack Day <https://software.ac.uk/cw23/hack-day>`_, where teams formed to work on projects generated during the Collaborative Ideas session and other ideas pitched during the course of the event.

Hack Day project pitches and team formation took place at the end of Day 2.
Participants took turns promoting a project to attract potential team members, and then breakout spaces were assigned for teams to form around the proposed projects: projects were assigned a number based on the order they were pitched, and participants located either the in-person table associated with that number or its associated breakout room to find out more and decide if they wanted to join that team.
One change from previous CWs, is that we removed the limit of the number of people that could be on a team, as this was the highest number of participants that have attended a CW Hack Day and we were limited both by availability of in-person space as well as time to present the project demos.

A spreadsheet was used for teams to register their projects and members, assign both in-person spaces and Zoom breakout rooms, list relevant Slack channels and communication pathways, as well as collect project links and repositories.
Again, we asked remote participants to include "(R)" at the end of their names when they signed up to Hack Day teams in the spreadsheet, and we assigned larger hybrid groups to rooms that had Meeting OWLs.
One Zoom room was used to facilitate the Hack Day, with breakout rooms created for each team, one for the judges, and a few extra side rooms.

The judges, comprised of Institute Staff, Fellows, and collaborators, met in one of the breakout spaces with a Meeting OWL where they discussed the `judging criteria <https://software.ac.uk/cw23/hack-day>`_ and visited each team twice virtually via Zoom.

The Hack Day presentations and demos session took place at the end of the day, and each team had five minutes to demonstrate their projects and how they met the judging criteria.

The judges then went into a breakout room to deliberate.
The teams that came in the `top three places <https://software.ac.uk/cw23/hack-day-entries-and-winners>`_ were awarded `Ember Mugs <https://uk.ember.com/products/ember-mug-2>`_ for first place, `Anker Power Banks <https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anker-PowerCore-Portable-Charger-MacBook/dp/B08P4J2Z7R/>`_ for second place, and `Anker USB C Chargers <https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anker-Charger-GaNPrime-3-Port-MacBook-Phantom-Black/dp/B09VZKPX1X/>`_ for third place.
As we did not know how many people would be a part of each team ahead of time, we ordered six of each prize to have at the event and procured the rest of the prizes after the event for the remaining winners.

Teaching
------------

Mini-workshops and Demos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Mini-workshops and demo sessions <https://software.ac.uk/cw23/mini-workshops-and-demo-sessions>`_ give an in-depth look at a particular tool or approach and a chance to query developers and experts about how this might apply to participants’ areas of work.

To adapt the mini-workshop and demo sessions for a hybrid event, we provided the following guidance during the call for proposals:

    CW23 is a hybrid event, and the Mini-workshops and demo sessions will have people facilitating and participating both in-person and remotely. A professional audio/visual company will be managing the video connection between the in-person room and the associated Zoom room, and helpers from the CW23 Organising Committee will be present to assist during the session. The use of of the CW23 `Sli.do <https://www.sli.do/>`_ can be provided.

    Proposers must consider how the session will be inclusive of both in-person and remote participants, and confirm if they will deliver the session in-person or remotely if selected. Facilitators will also need to attend a hybrid facilitation coaching and information session prior to the event if selected.

For CW23, we received a high number of excellent mini-workshop and demo session submissions and did everything we could to incorporate as many of them into the programme as possible:
- Instead of being offered a session, proposers for software demonstrations were invited to pre-record their demos to be published on the Institute's YouTube channel and present a lightning talk directing participants to the recording. These pre-recordings were also used to promote the event and projects across social media. (You can `view the playlist of demos here <https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpX1jXuNTXGoTJbk_HbKqMGBefEmcxRQU>`_.)
- We offered proposers whose sessions were predominantly comprised of facilitating discussions, to facilitate these discussions during the Discussion Session. We provided them with a templated Discussion session document ahead of time that they could populate with an outline of the discussion, and invited them to give a lightning talk to promote it ahead of the session.
- We then incorporated three 60-minute sessions devoted to contributed sessions as part of the main programme, accommodating 15 mini-workshops in total.

We hosted two coaching sessions for mini-workshop facilitators, and made the recordings and notes available to any facilitators who were unable to attend the sessions.
We answered any questions and provided the following guidance:

- Overview of how the mini-workshops will run

  - These Mini-workshop and demo sessions will be recorded and published to the `Institute’s Youtube channel <https://www.youtube.com/user/SoftwareSaved/>`_ under a Creative Commons - Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY 4.0) license after the event unless requested otherwise. (This was stated on the proposal submission form.)
  - Each block has 4 mini-workshop tracks in parallel, each comprising one 60-minute session or two 30-minute sessions.

    - There are buffer times and/or breaks before each session starts, so please arrive a few minutes early to test and prepare your setup.

  - CW23 will take place as a hybrid event.

    - In-person participation for the mini-workshops will take place in Foster, Robinson, Eddington and the Executive Boardroom (`view the venue floor plan here <https://assets.hyatt.com/content/dam/hyatt/hyattdam/documents/2020/01/15/1537/Hyatt-Regency-Manchester-Oxford-Road-Floor-Plan-English.pdf>`_ and `more information about the venue here <https://software.ac.uk/cw23/venue>`_).

      - There will be a podium with a microphone for presenters which the camera will point at.
      - There will also be 2 roving microphones available in each room.
      - Participant overflow will take place in the Rothwell Suite, where in-person participants will have to connect remotely.

    - Remote participation will be facilitated using `Zoom <https://zoom.us/>`_. Each of the parallel mini-workshop tracks will be using independent Zoom rooms so that you are able to create `breakout rooms <https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476093-Getting-Started-with-Breakout-Rooms>`_ in your sessions if you need to.
    - Both in-person and remote presenters will have to share any slides/screens via the Zoom room, so please make sure you have installed Zoom in advance if presenting from a personal laptop.

  - Each workshop will have designated SSI Helpers to assist with in-person and remote participation.

    - The SSI Helper(s) for In-person Participation will check-in with workshop facilitators and help them get set up in the room, liaise with the professional audio/visual team, and help with timekeeping.
    - The SSI Helper(s) for Remote Participation will act as Zoom Host to help assign workshop facilitators as Zoom Co-hosts, record the session, enable transcription/captioning, ensure the audio/video quality are good, and help with any technical issues.

      - Please note that SSI Remote Participation helpers are there to advocate for the remote participants, not co-run your session (unless there is only one facilitator for your session and you require assistance). We suggest designating one of your co-facilitators to engage with the remote participants during your session.

    - If you have any in-person setup requirements (such as setting up chairs for a panel discussion) or remote setup requirements (such as help setting up Zoom breakout rooms) you need to let these helpers know at the start of the session.

  - If you have anything specific that you might need help with, just let us know as soon as possible.

- Inclusive interactivity

  - The Mini-workshops and demo sessions will have people facilitating and participating both in-person and remotely. Please consider carefully how you plan to include everyone in your session’s activities.
  - The use of the CW23 `Sli.do <https://www.sli.do/>`_ can be provided to facilitate Q&A from in-person and remote participants or other interactive elements such as polls.

    - Please let me know as soon as possible if you need use of the CW23 Sli.do for your session. Sli.do links have been sent to those who already requested it in the proposal.
    - Another option is `Mentimeter <https://www.mentimeter.com/>`_, but we do not have an account to provide.

  - Session structure and collaborative notes documents

    - We have created a collaborative note-taking Google document for each of your workshops to help keep participants synchronised.
    - The document templates have the session logistics and general guidance at the top and you are free to populate the rest of the document however you see fit in order to best facilitate your session (for example, provide an agenda, space for questions and notes, any links, etc.).

      - We strongly recommend adding an agenda with timings to help keep your session on track.
      - Leave a bit of wiggle room. Make agenda sections longer than you think you need, or leave a few minutes unplanned at the end of the session in case something runs late. (For example, plan 50-55 minutes of content if you have a 60-minute session.)
      - 60-minute sessions are expected to have interactivity with the audience, and we expect 30-minutes to be more suited to presentations/demos with Q&A at the end, for example.
      - We recommend adding a link for people to access your slides in case they are unable to view them well on the screen.
      - We recommend adding links to where people can find more information or contact information for where they can follow up.

  - You can view examples from last year at CW22 `here <https://bit.ly/3Co82dG>`_ and `here <https://bit.ly/3HKCUpT>`_.
  - If this is not useful to your workshop, no problem, they are optional and there for your convenience. We just want to keep the ones that are used centralised with all the documents generated as part of CW23.
  - By default, these documents will be licensed `CC-BY-4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_ as per the `Participation Guidelines <https://software.ac.uk/cw23/participation-guidelines>`_ unless requested otherwise.
  - Session materials

    - If you would like to share any session materials such as presentation slides, you can submit them to the CW23 portal on Figshare following the guidance here: https://software.ac.uk/cw23/material-submission where you can generate a DOI for your conference outputs.

The mini-workshop sessions were assigned to the Eddington, Foster, Robinson rooms and the Executive Boardroom and each had their own designated Zoom account.
We generated templated Google Docs for each session that the facilitators were empowered to adapt for their use.
We directed participants to the different in-person and Zoom rooms in the day’s collaborative notes document, in the Slack channel, on slides presented to the plenary room, and logistical supporters were available to help direct people to where they wanted to go.

The professional audio/visual providers were responsible for the hybrid audio and video feeds between in-person and remote participants, however there were some issues with the microphone setup where microphones were tuned to the wrong room and caused interference.
Session facilitators shared their screens directly to Zoom, and the Zoom window was shared to the in-person room via a screen or projector.
The venue wifi also let down severely, causing some disruption particularly for session facilitators and remote participants and also impacted the quality of the session recordings.


Networking
------------

Coffee Chats (hybrid)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A breakout space was made available in the venue (in the Foster room) and off of the main event Zoom room before the official start of day for both in-person and remote participants to mingle, break the ice, connect and chat over their morning brew.


Lunch and Coffee Breaks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The venue provided coffees and teas on tap for the entire duration of the event.
Refreshments were also provided upon arrival and during the designated morning and afternoon coffee breaks.
Lunch was provided in the hotel restaurant, where we asked for two vegetarian mains and one meat main to be provided as part of the buffet.

We kept the main Zoom room open in case remote participants wanted to talk with other people.
We opened a number of breakout rooms as side rooms for participants to have conversations away from the main room and as sponsor booths for participants to chat with and learn more about the CW23 sponsors.


Drinks Reception and Dinner
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To be added.


Mindfulness Meditation session (hybrid)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To be added.
