CW23 Event Roles
=================

Like previous years, we ensured that we had at least two people assigned for each role/duty as contingency in case someone had to drop out of the event for any reason.
CW is the premier event of the Institute, so all staff were expected to attend and able to fill most roles.
Institute Fellows, collaborators and CW23 Sponsors filled remaining roles on the Code of Conduct Committee and Hack Day judging committee.

We created a duties roster with role descriptions, responsibilities and schedules; provided instructions for Zoom Hosts and Co-hosts; created a spreadsheet of the various roles and Zoom room links for the parallel sessions, and provided an index of links to point to all these documents and to help people find anything else related to CW23 that they would need (links to each day’s collaborative notes document, venue information, Zoom rooms, communication channels, session information, etc.).
This information was also printed out and assembled into binders to provide to the logistical supporters, see "During the Event" below.

See the :ref:`cw23-eps-timeline` for a breakdown of the various tasks and when they took place.
