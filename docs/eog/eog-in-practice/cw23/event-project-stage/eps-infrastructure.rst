CW23 Infrastructure
====================

As this was the Instituteâ€™s first hybrid CW, we kept the infrastructure the same from CW21 (see :ref:`cw21-eps-infrastructure`) and CW22 to reduce the number of moving parts and focus on adding in-person elements to our existing online setup.

For a future hybrid CW, looking into an all-encompassing virtual events platform that integrates registration, video conferencing, chat and more (such as Zoom Events) could be a natural next step.
