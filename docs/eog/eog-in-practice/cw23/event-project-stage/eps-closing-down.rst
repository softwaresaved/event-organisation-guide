CW23 Closing Down the Event Project Stage
==========================================


At the end of the event
-------------------------

We made participants aware that we would be gathering feedback, following up with them about speed blogs and their prizes at the end of the event.
We thanked the sponsors, volunteers, speakers and workshop facilitators for their contributions towards delivering the event, and we also thanked the participants for their engagement - without which the unconference would not have been a success.


After the event
-------------------------

We emailed participants with a form to collect feedback after the event.
We held a wash-up meeting with Institute Staff and CW23 Steering Committee members to celebrate the successes and discuss the feedback and lessons learned.

We got in touch with Collaborative Ideas, Hack Day and raffle winners to collect their mailing addresses and preferences on prizes.
We then procured the prizes and arranged for them to be sent to the winners.

We liaised with the venue, audio/visual provider, workshop dinner venue, and accommodation provider to update purchase orders and arrange invoices to be paid.

In the months after the event, we followed up on the speed blogs that were produced as part of the Discussion session.
We published them along with blog posts written by participants about their experiences, and processed and published the session recordings.
You can see the details of the CW23 outputs in the :ref:`cw23-eps-outputs-and-outcomes` and the timeline of when we made them available in the :ref:`cw23-eps-timeline`.


When are you done?
-------------------------

When all of the outputs that we planned to produce are available (locations of which are mentioned in the section above), the event is complete.
