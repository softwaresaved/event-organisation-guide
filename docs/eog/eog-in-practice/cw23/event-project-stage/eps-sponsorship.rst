CW23 Sponsorship
=================

We adapted the `sponsorship packages from CW22 <https://software.ac.uk/cw22/sponsorship>`_ to add more value to sponsors in a hybrid event and summarised the packages on the `CW23 website <https://software.ac.uk/cw23/sponsorship>`_.
We kept the tiered packages of Silver, Gold and Platinum, however we increased the donation amounts (to £1500, £3000 and £6000 respectively) and added in-person benefits in line with a hybrid event such as free in-person registrations.

We also added the following a la carte benefits:
- Accessibility and diversity fund (£1,000 each)
- Hack Day Prizes Sponsor (1 available - £4,000)
- Workshop Dinner Sponsor (1 available - £5,000)
- Audio/Video Sponsor (2 available - £10,000)

We invited partners that we have worked with previously, and also new partners related to the event themes and audience.
We also added a `sign-up form <https://forms.gle/zKAhDZQD7nxN7vNP7>`_ on the website for interested sponsors to contact us via.

We were delighted that `Figshare <https://figshare.com/>`_ joined us again with a bespoke package, and `The Alan Turing Institute <https://www.turing.ac.uk/>`_ joined us as a Platinum partner.
Representatives from the sponsoring organisations engaged with the programme through our Steering Committee, lightning talks, and mini-workshops.
Figshare also provided a `CW conference portal <https://ssi-cw.figshare.com/>`_ to capture and generate DOIs for the event outputs.

Sponsorship allowed us to procure COVID-19 antigen test kits and masks to support our COVID-19 policy, and offer more financial assistance to participants.
