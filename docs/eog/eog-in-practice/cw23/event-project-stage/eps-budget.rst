CW23 Budget
============

We knew in advance that we would be operating CW23 at a loss, as the Institute decided to absorb the significant costs associated with the professional audio/visual services provided and not pass these on to participants via the registration fee.
We kept the registration fee for remote participation at £50, and raised the cost of in-person participation to £275 (from £250 in 2019) due to the increased costs associated with catering and venue hire.
We estimated that there would be around 100 registrations, and that we would have one or two sponsors.

As we began to receive :ref:`sponsorship <cw23-eps-sponsorship>`, we were able to make decisions on additional costs to support our COVID-19 Policy, such as providing lateral flow antigen tests and masks for in-person participants, as well as offering more financial assistance to participants.
