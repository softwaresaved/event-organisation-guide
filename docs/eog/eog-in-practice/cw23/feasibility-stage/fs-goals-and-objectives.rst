     - Mental health
     - Wellbeing

 - Promote the Institute’s goals and activities related to the sub-theme of Sustainable technical development  such as Intermediate Research Software Development in Python, upskilling during the Research Software Camps, and training resources.
 - Promote the Institute’s goals and activities related to the sub-theme of Sustainable career development  such as Research Software Engineering, the Citation File Format, mentorship within the Research Software Camps and RSE, and inclusive leadership training.
 - Promote the Institute’s goals and activities related to the sub-theme of Sustainable personal development such as Mental Health in Research Software Engineering, wellbeing spotlight series, RSC4, and community building.
 - Unaddressed discussion topics related to the themes will be brought into the SSI Fellow's Community Calls, Research Software Camps, and other Institute activities.


Social
--------------------

Goals
 - Increase opportunities for participants to network, meet new people and start new collaborations.
 - Bring together the research software community and our Fellows in-person after 3 years of meeting online.

Objectives
 - Dedicated networking session which is inclusive of both in-person and remote participants.
 - Have a mix of different types of networking and social activities to encompass the diversity of participant attitudes and preferences towards networking.
 - Participants meet at least 7 new people.
 - Participants intend at least 1 new collaboration on average.


Diversity and inclusion
------------------------

Goals
 - Improve accessibility from the previous CW.
 - Increase diversity and representation from the previous CW (race, gender, career stage, role, location, etc.).
 - Increase opportunities for community members who are unable to attend to engage with the discussions.
 - Continue to show leadership in the way we run events and extend this to hybrid.
 - Explore how our community should do hybrid events, to show that there are ways of getting equitable participation, even if it is not an identical experience.

Objectives
 - Facilitate a hybrid event where the remote participants have an equally useful experience as in-person participants.
 - Design sessions for equal access from remote and in-person participants.
 - Include closed captioning / transcription services.
 - Provide advice to participants on how to get the most out of the hybrid unconference.
 - Ensure at least 50% of the keynote speakers are women.
 - Increase representation of people from ethnic minorities above the previous CW.
 - Measure and compare demographics between previous two CWs.
 - Develop social media strategy to promote discussion topics which arise during the unconference to include and engage community members who are unable to attend (e.g. due to location or other commitments).
 - At least 25% who have not attended CW before and are not Fellows or in the Fellowship application process.

Sponsorship
--------------------

Goals
 - Maintain relevance of sponsors to themes and audience.
 - Mitigate risk of losing sponsorship for future CWs.

Objectives
 - Reformulate sponsorship packages to account for hybrid event format and include more in-kind sponsorship options to engage sponsors for future partnership.
 - Target new sponsors compared to previous years (esp. Silver and Gold).
 - Invite sponsors from previous years to engage.

Technical
--------------------

Goals
 - Improve the documentation and infrastructure for running a CW as a hybrid event.

Objectives
 - Document process and lessons learned as we go along.
 - Successful use of AV and other services for inclusivity and equal access to programme.
 - Successful use of uCONFLY infrastructure (even if just by the organising team).
 - Use platforms appropriate for the sessions.
 - Participants take skills, techniques, tools and resources back to their communities.
