CW23 Venue
=============

CW23 will take place as a hybrid event.

Remote
--------------------

 - Ideally we will build off of the success and lessons learned from CW20-CW22, and use platforms that we gained experience and expertise with such as Zoom.
 - However, hiring an AV company to assist with the technical setup will be required per the venue and they may use different platforms/services.
 - Platforms for remote participation will be explored more thoroughly in the Event Project Stage.
 - Regardless of the online platform, we will need good quality AV recording and broadcasting to remote participants.

   - The AV supplier for the Hyatt is `Fisher AV <https://www.fisheraudiovisual.com/>`_.

 - Explore using an external event facilitation company during the :ref:`cw23-event-project-stage`.


In-person
--------------------

 - The `Hyatt Regency Manchester <https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/england-united-kingdom/hyatt-regency-manchester/manrm>`_ is currently being investigated for the in-person venue for CW23.
 - A specification of venue requirements (see :doc:`eps-venue`) and site visits have been carried out and meet our needs for CW23.

   - We asked the venue specifically about the robustness of the Wi-fi and discussed the details of our needs for hybrid interaction. The venue assured us repeatedly that the venue Wi-fi would be suitable for our needs and has supported large hybrid events in the past.

 - The venue has been checked for availability for the preferred dates and confirmed, see :ref:`cw23-fs-date`.
 - The Hyatt is located at the University of Manchester and therefore co-located with the Event Lead. This lessens the complexity for running our first hybrid CW, as there is no need to find additional local organisers to coordinate through.
