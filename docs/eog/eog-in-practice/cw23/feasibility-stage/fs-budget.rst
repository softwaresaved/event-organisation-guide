CW23 Budget
=============

The main budget items for a hybrid CW23 will be:

 - Venue hire
 - Audio/Visual
 - Catering
 - Registrations, travel and accommodation for invited speakers, Steering Committee members, and other key invitees
 - Eventbrite fee
 - Prizes for First, Second and Third place Collaborative Ideas groups
 - Prizes for First, Second and Third place Hack Day teams
 - Prizes for Feedback and COVID-19 self-testing raffles
 - Financial assistance for participants

Some of these costs can be covered by income from registrations (estimated registration cost £275 for in-person participation and £50 for remote participation) and sponsorship.
This registration fee is a slight increase from previous years (£250) due to the generally increased costs of everything.
The professional audio/visual services were expected to be a significant cost for hybrid event.
We anticipated delivering CW23 at a loss and did not pass the extra costs onto participants.


Additional Costs
--------------------

- SSI Staff travel and accommodation costs
- SSI Fellows travel and accommodation costs

   - We decided to cover registration, travel and accommodation costs for all Fellows who wanted to attend in-person or remotely (not just the currently "active" Fellows).
