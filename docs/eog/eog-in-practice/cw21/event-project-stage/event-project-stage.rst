CW21 Event Project Stage 
==========================

The idea was accepted and the constraints and practicalities have been signed off. 
Now we are in the Event Project Stage - it’s time to organise and deliver the event itself.

The Event Lead needs to think about infrastructure, setting a timeline, committees and roles needed in the run-up to the event, the details of the agenda, publicity, how to go about attracting sponsorship, event roles on the day and even how to close down the event.

The following sections go into these elements of CW21 in more detail.
