CW21 Feasibility Stage 
========================

During the `Feasibility Stage <https://event-organisation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/eog/feasibility-stage.html>`_ , the event idea is being explored more thoroughly. 
At this stage, various things are needed before a formal sign-off and progression to the Event Project Stage (i.e. before the Institute/main stakeholder agrees to take on the staff effort, financial risk and opportunities afforded by running the event).

The following sections include the information from the Feasibility Stage which is needed for evaluation by stakeholders.
