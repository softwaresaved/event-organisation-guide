Introduction
============

The Institute has built up a large amount of experience `organising events <https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/other-workshops>`_,  ranging from a few to around 100 attendees. Our `Collaborations Workshop (CW) <https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/collaborations-workshops>`_ series is an example of one of our larger and more complex events. The CW series combine audience-led sessions in the style of an `‘unconference’ <https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-09-28-running-unconference-top-tips>`_ and traditional workshop sessions. CW has around 80-100 attendees and there is no call for paper but a call for mini-workshops.

This guide goes through the steps of organising an event and is structured around the way the Institute organises its workshops and events.
